## Introduction

In the field of bioinformatics, identifying RNA genes is crucial for understanding the genome's functionality. **pyaragorn** simplifies this process by providing a straightforward interface to ARAGORN, which is designed to locate tRNA and mtRNA genes efficiently. Whether you are a researcher or a developer, this library can enhance your projects by streamlining RNA gene identification.

## Features

- **Cython Bindings**: Leverage the speed of Cython for performance-critical applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Use the library directly in your Python projects with minimal setup.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Access detailed guides and examples to get started quickly.
- **Support for Multiple RNA Types**: Identify tRNA, mtRNA, and tmRNA genes seamlessly.

## Installation

To install **pyaragorn**, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darkranger22/pyaragorn.git
   cd pyaragorn
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Build the Cython bindings:

   ```bash
   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
   ```

5. Optionally, you can download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/darkranger22/pyaragorn/releases). Download the appropriate file, then execute it to set up the library.

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started with **pyaragorn**:

```python
from pyaragorn import Aragorn

# Initialize the ARAGORN object
aragorn = Aragorn()

# Load your genomic sequence
sequence = "ATGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC"

# Find RNA genes
results = aragorn.find_genes(sequence)

# Print the results
for gene in results:
    print(f"Found gene: {gene}")
```

This code snippet initializes the ARAGORN object, loads a genomic sequence, and prints out the identified RNA genes. You can expand this example to include more advanced features and options available in the library.
